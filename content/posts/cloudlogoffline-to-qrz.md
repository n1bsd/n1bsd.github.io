Do you ever wanted to log QSOs offline with an Android/iOS/Desktop app and then upload them to the QRZ logbook? Now you can. Since I am not capable of developing such an app and there is already a really good app with CloudlogOffline, I have developed CloudlogOffline2QRZ. It is a simple Python application that pretends to be a Cloudlog instance.

It offers a similar API to Cloudlog and forwards all transmitted QSOs to the QRZ.com logbook. This way you can use CloudlogOffline e.g. on your smartphone for logging and then upload the QSOs to QRZ.com via CloudlogOffline2QRZ.

You can find the code and more information [here](/files/CloudlogOffline2QRZ.tar.gz).
