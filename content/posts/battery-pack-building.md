I have inherited the following collection of battery packs, which were already at least 5 years old at this time:

Two battery packs should now be built from them: One as power supply for my Yaesu FT-817 during portable operation and another bigger one from the remaining cells. For this I took all packs apart, charged each cell and then measured their capacity:

I also needed do order a spot welder kit for this. After I received the spot welder kit, I assembled it and built the smaller battery pack (4s2p) of the two with 14,8V and a capacity of 6200mAh. Worked fine but I had to use a 100Ah battery as power source to make it actually weld.

The spot welder:

Then I've built the bigger battery pack in a 4s6p configuration with 14,8V and a cpacity of around 12,5Ah:
