After I've built the [QubeDX](/qubedx/) for the higher bands (20 to 10m) and it's little brother, the [QubeDX S](/qubedx-s/) for the lower bands, I've realized that it would make more sense to combine both cubes into one. This time I wanted it as compact as possible so I went for the footprint of the QubeDX S but added 30mm in height.

The final version now consists of:

* [QRPLabs QDX 5W digital transceiver kit](https://qrp-labs.com/qdx) (high band version)
* [QRPLabs QDX 5W digital transceiver kit](https://qrp-labs.com/qdx) (low band version)
* Raspberry Pi 5 with active cooling + NVMe SSD
* two buck converters

## The Result

The following pictures show the finished setup:
