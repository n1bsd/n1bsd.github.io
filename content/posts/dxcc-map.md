I have firmly resolved [to worry less about awards and QSLs](/on-qsling/) in general. I still log my QSOs and upload them to QRZ.com and LotW, but I only do the latter for my communication partners. I personally consider logging itself to be very important and I will never give it up. However, I was looking for a solution to keep track of the DXCC entities I had already worked. Then I had the admittedly not really new idea of simply pinning flags into a world map. This is now hanging on the wall of my shack:

A great synergy effect arose from the fact that I set all the pins together with my kids, giving them a little geography lesson through the back door.
