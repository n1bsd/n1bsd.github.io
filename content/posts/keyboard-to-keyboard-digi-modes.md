When I started amateur radio in 2019, I initially only considered FT8 and FT4, as it is a very simple and straightforward way to get into the hobby - also because I still was very mic shy. I was already experimenting with other digi modes like PSK31 and RTTY, but my main goal was to work as many countries on as many bands as possible and as quickly as possible. To achieve this, FT8 and FT4 are very suitable and have been instrumental in achieving first the DXCC and later the WAS award.

However, for various reasons, I have [recently decided to distance myself from working new DXCC entities and focus on the person behind the station I am working](/on-qsling/). FT8 is therefore of not much use and I now mainly use it for general tests or QRP experiments. Since I don't know CW, the only thing left is SSB or the (for me) forgotten keyboard to keyboard digi modes.

One of the biggest hurdles for me was to get [Fldigi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fldigi) (a very popular open source for Digital Modes in Amateur Radio) working together with [Quisk](https://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/) (Python based SDR software for the Hermes Lite 2 transceiver amongst others). [Now that I have managed to do this](/quisk-fldigi/), I have finally been able to try out various alternative digi modes again.

I was actually mainly interested in newer modes like Olivia, Contestia or Thor, but unfortunately there seems to be less activity here. However, I was able to make many nice QSOs in PSK31 in the last few days. Most of them were rather macro-based and comparable to the mouse to mouse FT8 experience, but a few were actually real keyboard to keyboard conversations. Interestingly, these 30-40 minute ragchews were all DX QSOs.

I find it absolutely fascinating to be able to make longer intercontinental conversations with just a little power and even in less than ideal conditions. You have a lot more time to think during the conversation as it would be in SSB, which is very helpful if you're not talking/typing in your native language. I used a mixture of macros and manual keystrokes to automate, for example, the beginning of each pass or the transitions to the other station, but also longer blocks of text such as the station description.

But even with macro-based QSOs you learn much more about the person on the other side than in any FT8 or in most SSB QSOs. It was the latter in particular that I realized with regret. SSB remains my main mode, but I have now found a functioning alternative mode that meets my requirements.

I would like others to give the many different keyboard to keyboard modes available a chance. I keep reading about younger radio amateurs who don't dare to try SSB and prefer to communicate via the computer and then use FT8.

The main message of this post: __Modes like Olivia, JS8call and PSK31 offer a great opportunity to communicate non-verbally but still personally. It could be the perfect way to enjoy ham radio as an introvert or as a ham with a sub-optimal antenna situation in a way that it's still a personal communication between humans.__
