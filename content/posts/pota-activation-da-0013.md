Yesterday I had a very successful activation of POTA park "DA-0013 Stromberg-Heuchelberg Nature Park". I found a nice spot but had to fight with strong winds so I wasn't able to work on 20m for a longer time since my antenna was flexing a lot. Most of the total 51 contacts were made on 10m followed by 12m.
