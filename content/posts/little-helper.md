Here's the result of my attempt to recreate [Gyro Gearloose's Little Helper (in German: Daniel Düsentrieb's Helferlein)](https://www.duckipedia.de/Helferlein):


![](/img/little-helper-1.jpg)


It's built out of:

  * aluminium tubes
  * brass sticks
  * wooden shoes and gloves
  * lots of two-component adhesive
  * a 12V 40W bulb with E27 thread
  * some wire
  * a AC/DC converter 12V 3A
