Had a very nice and special POTA activation of [DE-0094  Nieders√§chsisches Wattenmeer National Park](https://pota.app/#/park/DE-0094):

Conditions were rough but I've managed to get 16 stations into my log, including two from the Azores. It was great to sit on a dyke, watch people kite and enjoy the view of the sea while talking to stations all over Europe.

My rig was the usual: Xiegu G90 and a 5.4m long telescopic vertical antenna with four 5m radials.
