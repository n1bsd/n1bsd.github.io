The following comparison between a Hustler 5-BTV vertical antenna, a Cobweb antenna and an M0PLK Delta Loop is not a scientific treatise, but rather my personal experience. The comparisons naturally only refer to the bands covered by all antennas and relate to operation at my QTH.

## Hustler 5-BTV Vertical Antenna

The Hustler is a 7.50m long vertical antenna, which I use in my garden at ground level. Below the turf there is a radial network consisting of approx. 30 wires of different lengths (approx. 1 to 3m) which covers approx. 200 degrees around the antenna.

This antenna covers the bands 10, 15, 20, 40 and 80m, however the 80m is so narrowbanding that after tuning the antenna only FT8 operation without tuner is possible. All other bands are resonant and fully usable. On 40m I can work the whole of Europe in SSB without any problems. On the 10, 15 and 20m bands I do practically no radio operation, as the antenna is clearly inferior to the others available. This applies to both reception and transmission.

Of all the shortwave antennas at my QTH, this one picks up the most local QRM. The antenna is mainly used for 40m SSB operation, 80m FT8 operation and WSPR on all available bands.


## Cobweb Antenna

The Cobweb antenna is a 7 band antenna which covers the following bands: 4, 6, 10, 12, 15, 17 and 20m. I have never used this antenna on 4 or 6m, which is why I have no experience and therefore exclude these bands from this review. It works well at a lower height of approx. 5m. Due to its small dimensions of 2.55m x 2.55m, it is very suitable for small gardens and does not require a rotator due to its almost uniform omnidirectional pattern.

It picks up significantly less local interference than the Hustler and also seems to have significantly more gain on the 10, 15 and 20m bands, which I have established through A/B tests in regular radio operation. 

The antenna is somewhat narrowbanding on some bands, which is why it is worth operating it with a tuner. This is particularly necessary when the antenna is wet due to rain or snow. This leads to a significant change in the VSWR.

Even on an 8m long aluminium telescopic mast, this antenna does not need to be guyed, although it will rock considerably in storms.

## M0PLK Delta Loop Antenna

The [M0PLK Delta Loop](/m0plk-delta-loop/) is a multi-band antenna designed for use on the 10, 12, 15, 17 and 20m bands. It measures approx. 5m x 5.50m and has a bidirectional radiation pattern. The use of an antenna rotor is therefore recommended. I have mounted the Delta Loop on a telescopic aluminium mast at about 6m above ground (measured between the balun box and the ground), but I have been told that it should also work well at much lower heights, such as 3m.

Furthermore, an antenna tuner is required for operation, with which the antenna can also be tuned - with corresponding losses - to 30 and 40m. It has so far proved to be insensitive to changes in weather conditions and shows no change in VSWR in rain or snow.

Unfortunately, A/B testing is not possible with the Cobweb, so the following statements are subjective: I feel that the Delta Loop gives a better signal to noise ratio than the Cobweb. I think I can also hear quieter stations much better.

I've had a considerable number of QSOs with W8HF over in Ohio using the Cobweb before and now also with the Delta Loop. While it was difficult to copy me before, I've gotten much better reports now, suggesting that the M0PLK is significantly better performing, at least between DL and Ohio.

Thanks to its bidirectionality, I can reduce unwanted signals by one, sometimes two S levels by turning the antenna. I've done an experiment with two stations, one in Northern Ireland and one with W8HF in Ohio, USA. While the European station didn't experience much difference between different beam directions, my signal varied from S3 to S7 for W8HF, depending on where I was beaming to.
