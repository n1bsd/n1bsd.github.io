The Matrix HAM Radio Space, which which is hosted and administered by [M0AWS](https://m0aws.co.uk/), is a slowly but steadily growing community of radio amateurs who are actively exchanging ideas and information via the Matrix chat network. Hosted on M0AWS's Matrix server, the [Ham Radio Space](https://matrix.to/#/#ham-radio-space:matrix.m0aws.co.uk) now includes several rooms on satellite radio, antenna construction, Meshtastic and many other topics. There are of course also rooms for the exchange of information on general topics. The [opensource.radio](/opensource-radio) project that I recently launched also has a room there, where not only the content of the wiki can be discussed, but also changes to the wiki can be notified via a bot.

A weekly Matrix QO-100 Roundtable Net at 16:30 UK Time (UTC+1) on Freq: 10489.873+/- has been taking place via the QO-100 satellite for some time, but now there was also a desire to be able to exchange ideas via another voice mode. AllStarLink with additional Echolink access was chosen due to its outstanding audio quality. The dedicated ASL node 57881 has now been installed and is available for use.

Interested radio amateurs, SWLs or those who want to become one of the two are invited to join the Matrix Space and thus an experimental, friendly and competent community as well as to join the new AllStarLink node either via ASL or Echolink.

There is also a dedicated [Digital Voice Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#digitalvoice:matrix.m0aws.co.uk) for discussing everything AllStarLink and beyond. This room also has a bot that notifies any connecting or disconnecting nodes to the Matrix Ham Community AllStarLink node.

If you don't own a personal RF enabled AllStarLink node yet, I can recommend to take a look at the following links:
