In this post I will briefly describe my build of an AllStarLink node. For this, I used the following parts:

 * Baofeng 888s
 * CM108 USB soundcard
 * Raspberry Pi 4 + case
 * two buck converters, configured 5V and 3,7V output voltage
 * metal enclosure
 * power poles + mounting plates
 * ethernet jack
 * [Waveshare LCD1602 RGB Module](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/LCD1602_RGB_Module)

I will not go into great detail here since all modifications are described in other places. Please consult the following links:

Please ignore the two audio transformers. I planned to install them but went with a transformerless build in the end.

Here is the modified sound fob as described in the above link:

A first test with the RPi and the buck converters built in:
