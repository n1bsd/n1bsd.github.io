## Introduction

nsd-dyndns is a simple script that adds dynamic DNS dunctionality to NSD (authoritative DNS name server).

## Requirements

The following is required or suggested:

  * OpenBSD (or another BSD or some Linux distro) with HTTPD and NSD installed (pkg_add nsd), configured and running
  * (sub-)domain for your webserver. Needed for updating the NS record of your actual DynDNS domain.
      * In this example: _update.example.com_
  * (sub-)domain that is updated dynamically.
      * In this example: _dyn.example.com_
  * A router capable of sending custom GET-requests to your DynDNS server.
      * In this example: A FritzBox

## Installation

### Configure your HTTPD

Add the following new virtual host to your _/etc/httpd.conf_:

     server "update.example.com" {
        listen on $ext_addr port 80
        root "/htdocs/dyndns"
        log access dyndns.log
     }

Create an empty _update.html_:

    # mkdir /var/www/htdocs/dyndns/
    # touch /var/www/htdocs/dyndns/update.html

After reloading HTTPD, try to access [http://update.example.com/update.html] The request should show up in _/var/www/logs/dyndns.log_

### **Create a zone file for dyn.example.com**

Create a new zone file (e.g. at _/var/nsd/zones/dyn.example.com.zone_) with the following content

    $ORIGIN example.com.
    $TTL 300
    @ IN SOA ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
    1524952218
    300 ; refresh
    900 ; retry
    1209600 ; expire
    1800 ; ttl
    )

    ; Name servers
    IN NS ns1.example.com.
    IN NS ns1.example.com.

    ; A records
    @ IN A 123.123.123.123
    update IN A 123.123.123.123
    dyn IN A 123.123.123.123

Don't forget to set your own domain names, name servers and ip addresses Furthermore, add this zone file to your _/var/nsd/etc/nsd.conf_

### Configure and Install nsd-dyndns

  * Download the scripts here: [nsd-dyndns.tar.gz](/files/nsd-dyndns.tar.gz)
  * Copy dyndns.conf-dist to /etc/dyndns.conf
      * _\# cp dyndns.conf-dist /etc/dyndns.conf_
  * Edit /etc/dyndns.conf to your needs
  * Copy dyndns.sh to /usr/local/bin/dyndns.sh
      * _\# cp dyndns.sh /usr/local/bin/dyndns.sh_
  * Make the script executable:
      * _\# chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/dyndns.sh_
  * Add /usr/local/bin/dyndns.sh to your crontab

### Configure your router

Configure your router to query the following URL:

    http://update.example.com/update.html?qwertzuiop1234567890

Don't forget to set your own domain name and to replace the string after "?" with the password you configured in the config file.

## What it does

When your router gets a new IP and therefore sends an HTTP request to your server, a similar entry should appear in your /var/www/logs/dyndns.log:

    update.example.com 123.123.123.123 - - [29/Apr/2018:20:48:19 +0200] "GET /update.html?qwertzuiop1234567890 HTTP/1.1" 200 6

When the script is executed e.g. via cron, the following happens:

  * It greps the last line of /var/www/logs/dyndns.log where the correct password was found and extracts the requesting IP address
  * It checks if this IP is the same than the last time
  * If it's a new IP, then it replaces the forth line in your zone file (the line with the version number) with a new version (current unix time stamp)
  * As a second step, it updates the A record of you DynDNS domain (dyn.example.com in our example)
  * It then stores the new IP in the file /tmp/last\_dyndns\_ip.txt
  * Finally it reloads NSD
