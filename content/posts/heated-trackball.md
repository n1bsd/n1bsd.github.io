## Parts needed

  * Heating wire (0,2mm 43,95 Ohm/m Kanthal D)
  * some regular wire
  * glue
  * soldering equipment

Since the USB port should ghive us 500mAh and the trackball shouldn't
consume more than 150mAh, the wire might consume 350mAh. Knowing the
voltage of 5V and the desired power consumption, it is easy to
calculate the needed resistor:

The heating wire has a resistance of 43,95 Ohm per meter, the wire
needs to be 33cm long in order to consume 350mAh:
