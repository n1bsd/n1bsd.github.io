Yesterday I was able to succesfully activate [POTA](https://parksontheair.com) park ["Taunus Nature Park"](https://pota.app/#/park/DA-0034) on the [Feldberg near Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fer_Feldberg).

The following was my gear during the portable operation:

 * Yaesu FT-817
 * DIY 6600mAh 4s LiPo battery
 * modified mic with built in voice keyer (BX-184)
 * self made 1/4 wave vertical antenna for 20m
 * 7m Spiderbeam mini mast

Due to the weather conditions, I only operated for one hour in total but I've made 22 SSB contacts on 20m from which four were DX and one was a park 2 park to Iceland. All this with just 5W - which was amazing!

This was my QTH this day:
