I wrote a Vim syntax plugin for writing [Fast Log Entry](https://df3cb.com/fle/) compatible log files in Vim. This allows me to write extensive logs with a lightweight Linux laptop on the console in Vim while operating portable without the need of a Fast Log Entry install but still with the very helpful syntax highlighting.

This plugin does not convert the log into ADIF files. The idea is to copy/paste the log later on into FLE and to the convertion there.

You can find a nice write-up on FLE at [https://wb3gck.com/2016/01/13/fast-log-entry-fle/](https://wb3gck.com/2016/01/13/fast-log-entry-fle/) (thanks to W8EMV for mentioning it).
