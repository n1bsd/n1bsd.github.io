To spread the word about amateur radio, I've submitted my [Declaration of Love to Amateur Radio](/a-declaration-of-love-to-amateur-radio/) as an article for the [2600: The Hacker Quarterly magazine](https://www.2600.com/). It may not really be an article on the topic of hacking, but there are certainly overlaps. That's why I thought that readers might be interested in this topic - and fortunately, the article was published [in the current issue (Summer 2024)](https://store.2600.com/collections/pdf-downloads/products/summer-2024-digital-edition-pdf-or-epub3).

I am a long-time reader of the magazine and am glad to have been able to contribute to it.
