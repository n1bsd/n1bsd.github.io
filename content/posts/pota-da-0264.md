Today I had the opportunity to be the first to successfully activate the ["Cuxhavener KÃ¼stenheiden National Park" (DA-0264)](https://pota.app/#/park/DA-0264). This POTA park is located in the north of germany, not far from the north sea coast, which is currently struggling with very stormy weather. I was lucky enough to catch a time window in which it was only raining intermittently and not too heavily and in which I was able to extend the 5.6m long telescopic antenna to the required length without it being damaged by the wind.

Band conditions were strange but quite good on 20m. I was able to work 29 stations (12 unique countries, 3 US states) in just over an hour before it started to rain heavily again.

The working conditions were the same as during the last activations:

 * Transceiver: Xiegu X5105
 * Amplifier: [MX-P50M](/mx-p50m-mod/), 40W
 * Antenna: [PAC-12](/review-pac-12-antenna/)
 * Battery: [Miady 7.2Ah LiFePO4](/miady-powerpole-lid/)
