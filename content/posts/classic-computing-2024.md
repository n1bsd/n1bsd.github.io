This afternoon I visited the [Classic Computing 2024](https://www.classic-computing.org/cc2024/). This event, which took place in Pfedelbach near Heilbronn, Germany, is described by the organiser as follows:

_"The Classic Computing 2024 will show a wide range of exhibits from the areas of office computers, gaming computers, game consoles, workstations, typewriters and calculators. Almost all of the devices are set up to be functional, and many can be used and tested. We will also be on hand to provide advice on restorations and repairs, and you can get support with repairing devices at our repair caf√©. The event will be rounded off by a wide-ranging programme of lectures."_

I really liked both the venue and the exhibits. You could often get into conversations with the owners of the devices and learn a few new things. I only knew many of the computers by name, so I now had the opportunity to take a closer look at them.

Here are a few pictures I took during my visit:
