This is not an ordinary blog post and it will not interest most readers. But for me personally it serves to record which [Doom](/playing-doom-in-2024/) WADs I have already played and what my verdict is on them. Having already played a few WADs, I've unfortunately lost track of them and would now like to take a more structured approach. 

It's worth mentioning that I'm a casual player with a mediocre skill level. I started playing a few MegaWADs and was very enthusiastic at the beginning, but the game became so difficult towards the end that I lost interest and quit. I play to relax, I have enough challenges in real life. I also like simple oldschool maps. If the flow is right, I have fun with a WAD.

The following table lists all WADs in the order in which I have played them and describes whether I have played through the WAD and if not, why.
