This little Raspberry Pi based project is a gift for my wife's grandmother for her 90th birthday. Being¬†visually impaired, she is hard to entertain but loves to listen to audiobooks. The problem is, that she isn't able to handle a ghetto blaster or MP3 player.

The solution to this problem was &#8211; tadaaaah &#8211; a one button audiobook player üôÇ

It basically consists of:

  * 1 Raspberry Pi
  * 1 [ModMyPi enclosure](https://www.modmypi.com/)
  * 1 button
  * 2 resistors (330 Ohm, 10 Kilo-Ohm)
  * 1 blue LED
  * 1 (slow) 8GB SD-Card
  * some wire
  * a pair of speakers

The following software has been used:

  * Raspbian minimal image ([http://www.linuxsystems.it/2012/06/raspbian-wheezy-armhf-raspberry-pi-minimal-image](http://www.linuxsystems.it/2012/06/raspbian-wheezy-armhf-raspberry-pi-minimal-image/))
  * mpd (music player daemon)
  * mpc
  * mpd-python
  * pyudev (for USB access)
  * a self-written python script

The features are the following:

  * **always on:** When you power on the raspberry, it will boot up and start the python script with the audio book in pause
  * **one button usage:** The button pauses and unpauses the audio book or goes back one track when you press the button longer than 4 seconds
  * **remembers position:** It will always remember the last played position
  * **only one audiobook:** There will always be only one audio book on the Raspberry
  * **easy audio book deployment:** When you plug in a USB thumb drive with a special name/label, the Raspberry will stop playing, mount the thumb drive, deletes the old audio book, copies the new one, rebuilds the playlist and &#8211; after unplugging the thumb drive &#8211; starts the new audiobook in pause mode
  * **multi format:** Since it uses mpd, the player supports¬†¬†Ogg Vorbis,¬†FLAC, OggFLAC,¬†MP2,¬†MP3,¬†MP4/AAC,¬†MOD,¬†Musepack¬†and¬†wave

If you like to build your own one button audio book player, here are the super simple schematics:

And last but not least &#8211; the python script. The code might be crappy, please comment if you have improvements (especially regarding loadMusic). You can find it here:

Here's what Russel wrote in a comment to this post:

    I just completed building this and have some addendum notes adding more details:
    Install the following packages:
    sudo apt-get install mpd
    sudo apt-get install mpc
    sudo apt-get install python-mpd
    sudo apt-get install python-pyudev

    (below assumes using defaults for /etc/mpd.conf)
    sudo mkdir -p /music/usb
    sudo ln -s /var/lib/mpd /music/mpd
    sudo ln -s /var/lib/mpd/music /music/mp3

    Copy the tobabp.py script to /home/pi
    nano /home/pi/tobabp.py

    Change these in the script or flip the connections in wiring diagram.
    BUTTON = 17
    LED = 24

    Testing

    Rename a USB stick to ‚Äú1GB‚Äù
    Copy 1 MP3 onto the stick

    Insert the stick into pi
    sudo mount /dev/sda1 /music/usb
    sudo /etc/init.d/mpd stop
    sudo rm /music/mp3/*
    sudo cp /music/usb/* /music/mp3/
    sudo umount /music/usb

    Remove the USB stick
    sudo rm /music/mpd/tag_cache
    sudo /etc/init.d/mpd start
    mpc clear
    mpc ls
    mpc ls | mpc add
    sudo /etc/init.d/mpd restart
    mpc play

    Plug in earphones
    You should hear audio

    Next try the python script:
    sudo python /home/pi/tobabp.py

    Insert USB stick
    the LED should flash and the USB file copy to /music/mp3/
    the LED should flash again. Remove the Stick and LED flashes again.
    Press button to start playing
    Press button again to stop
    Press & hold button to rewind to beginning.
    sudo crontab -e
    Add following line run at startup
    @reboot python /home/pi/tobabp.py &
    sudo reboot

    Then retest again to be sure all is well.
