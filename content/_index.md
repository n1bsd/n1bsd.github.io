This website is dedicated to [amateur radio](/a-declaration-of-love-to-amateur-radio/), electronic tinkering, retro computing, homelab building and other (mostly technical) topics.

The idea behind this site is to document my various projects, to make them available to others and to myself, so that I don't forget the solutions.

If you are interested in the story behind the domain rz01.org, you can [read it here](/why-rz01-org). In case you want to contact me by mail: The address starts with "hello" followed by "@" and ends with the domain of this site.

**DISCLAIMER:** Reproduction of my own projects or those of others presented here is at your own risk! I am neither responsible for any damage to the equipment involved nor for any potential injuries. This is a hobby website, all content should only serve as a suggestion and not as a copy template. Think for yourself and scrutinize my actions.
