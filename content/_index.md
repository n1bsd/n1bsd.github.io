This website is dedicated to [amateur radio](/a-declaration-of-love-to-amateur-radio/) and electronic tinkering. I also rarely write about retro computing or about topics related to GNU/Linux or BSD.

The idea behind this site is to document my various projects, to make them available to others and to myself, so that I don't forget the solutions.

If you are interested in the story behind the domain rz01.org, you can [read it here](/why-rz01-org).

**DISCLAIMER:** Reproduction of my own projects or those of others presented here is at your own risk! I am neither responsible for any damage to the equipment involved nor for any potential injuries. This is a hobby website, all content should only serve as a suggestion and not as a copy template. Think for yourself and scrutinize my actions.
