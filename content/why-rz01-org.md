What is this domain all about and how does it relate to this website?

I can answer the latter directly: The domain does not reflect the content of this site and has nothing to do with amateur radio, information security, retro computing or anything else. But it is short, sounds technical and raises questions. So not bad at all for a technical blog.

What this domain is about in general is easier to explain: I once worked as a sysadmin for a company that hosted its own systems. That was when the world was still more or less in order and was a while ago. The servers were in a server room in the basement of the office building. This room wasn't particularly large and apart from a raised floor and air conditioning, it didn't really have the feel of a data center. Nevertheless, they were very proud of it and called it RZ01. RZ stands for "Rechenzentrum", which means "data center" in English. As if that wasn't funny enough, the room was also given the number "01" to prepare for potential growth. 

When I bought a house many years later, a small room in the basement of the house was chosen as the location for a small 19" rack for the router, network switch, patch panel, NAS, home lab, etc. Since then, I have affectionately called this room RZ01 as a homage to the data center described. 

For the internal domain of my home lab, I eventually decided to register rz01.org. All third level domains for internal systems are resolved internally, the second level domain was initially unconfigured. At some point, I came up with the idea of simply using it for my website.

And that's the story of rz01.org.
